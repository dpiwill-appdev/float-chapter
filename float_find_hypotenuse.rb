# A right triangle's two shorter sides have length 2.8 and 4.5. How long is its longest side?
# Check the pythagorous.png file for the Pythagorean Theorem
#
# Your output should be a number; for example,
#
# 5.3

short_1 = 2.8
short_2 = 4.5

longest_side = Math.sqrt(short_1 ** 2 + short_2 ** 2)
puts longest_side
